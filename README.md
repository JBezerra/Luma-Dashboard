## Install Dependencies

``` bash
# install react
npm install -g create-react-app
# install dependencies
npm install
```
## Run Application

``` bash
npm start
```

## What is?
A simple Dashboard in React inspired in [Paper Dashboard React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-dashboard-react/#/dashboard) that shows the information of the database that is fed by Luma Bot.

## How it works?
I open an Observable with ```<FirebaseDatabaseProvider>``` that waits for changes in the database. 

For every time that it's checks, It adds the informations embedded in "Pessoas" (```Pessoas.jsx```) component in an array named ```pessoas```.

After that, It can render all components of the array in a ```<CardBody>```.
